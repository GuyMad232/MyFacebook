# FaceBook App

## üìù Description
We have developed a desktop application that interfaces with Facebook‚Äôs API. The application is designed to offer the user an experience similar to that on Facebook‚Äôs official site,
incorporating a variety of classical use cases that mimic standard usage on the site, with additional features to enhance the overall user experience.
The system presents smooth user experiences even in cases of authentication failure or missing user information through the usage of Try/Catch/Finally methodology and Mock Data.

## üß© Design-Patterns

   1. Singleton
   2. Fa√ßade
   3. Static Factory Class
   4. Iterator
   5. Observer
   6. Strategy
   7. Command

### Design Pattern No. 1 ‚Äì Singleton

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
The Singleton pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It was chosen to maintain a single, globally accessible instance of `GameResults` to store the game results of the current session. This instance is accessed by three different classes: `FormMain`, `LeaderBoardFacade`, and `FormLeaderBoard`, each having different responsibilities. Using Singleton ensures synchronized access to game results, improving runtime efficiency by avoiding redundant object creation and ensuring data consistency across different classes and threads.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
The Singleton pattern prevents multiple creations of `GameResults` and ensures any class trying to create another instance will receive the already created object. This ensures synchronized, thread-safe access, preventing overwriting of data and guaranteeing data consistency across classes.

### Implementation Method:
- **Class & Method Creation:**
   - The `GameResults` class houses the singleton with a public static function, `CreateOrGetGameResults`, allowing external access to the instance, and a private constructor preventing direct instantiation.
- **Double Check Lock Implementation:**
   - Implemented to ensure thread-safe access to object creation.
- **Helper Functions:**
   - Functions like `GetGameResultsLoses`, `GetGameResultsWins`, and `UpdateGameResults` facilitate access and modification of game results.
- **Fields:**
   - Fields like `s_GameResults`, `m_Loses`, `m_Wins`, and `sr_GameResultsLock` are added to store and manage the game results effectively.

## Design Pattern No. 2 ‚Äì Fa√ßade

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
The Fa√ßade pattern was used to simplify the interface for the "Guessing Game", separating the computational logic and database management from the UI. This makes the system more user-friendly, hides complexities, and ensures code readability and system maintainability.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
The Fa√ßade pattern offers a simplified, unified interface (`LeaderBoardFacade`) to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use and promoting subsystem independence and portability.

### Implementation Method:
- **Class & Method Creation:**
   - `LeaderBoardFacade` class encapsulates the computational logic, and `FormLeaderBoard` manages UI logic and data presentation.
- **Helper Functions:**
   - Various functions handle specific computational and database management tasks.
- **UI Logic:**
   - The `FormLeaderBoard` class focuses mainly on UI interactions and leverages logic located in the fa√ßade to keep UI class coherent.

 ## Design Pattern No. 3 ‚Äì Static Factory Class

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
This pattern was implemented to facilitate the creation of objects inheriting from `Form`. It enhances code maintainability and extensibility by allowing alterations in object creation logic without impacting the Client's code.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
It provides a unified and simplified method to create different `Form` objects, centralizing the object creation process and encapsulating the instantiation logic.

### Implementation Method:
- **Class & Method Definition:**
   - A separate `StaticFormFactory` class holds the `CreateFormFactory` function responsible for creating Forms.
- **Dynamic & Safe Creation:**
   - The factory function can safely parse the requested `Form` type from a string, allowing dynamic `Form` creation.
- **Type Handling & Error Management:**
   - The created objects are returned as type `Form`, allowing the Client side to cast to the relevant `Form` using "as".

 ## Design Pattern No. 4 ‚Äì Iterator

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
The Iterator pattern was chosen to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It allows comfortable iteration over a list of famous people in the database, maintaining the legacy code, and offering flexibility and maintainability.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
It allows the `GuessingGame` class to access information conveniently without considering the specific data structure in which the details of the famous people are held.

### Implementation Method:
- **Class Creation:**
   - A `FamousPerson` class holds the details of each famous person, and `EnumerableFamousPersons` class enables iteration.
- **Efficient Iteration:**
   - Uses yield return methodology for efficient iteration and performance improvement, encapsulated within a using clause to ensure proper disposal of the iterator.

## Design Pattern No. 5 ‚Äì Observer, Command

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
The Observer pattern was chosen to facilitate dynamic updating of controls in response to user-preferred ‚ÄúDark-Mode‚Äù settings. It maintains class independency and allows seamless notification of state changes in the `DarkMode` class to subscribed classes, enhancing extendability and flexibility of the application.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
This pattern enables all subscribed observers to be notified about state changes, acting independently according to their defined responses, thus promoting high cohesion, loose coupling, and adaptability to changes.

### Implementation Method:
- **Subject Class:**
   - `DarkMode` class constitutes the Subject, maintaining a Boolean field `m_Enabled` describing the system state and string field `m_Status` saving the system status.
   - It also has a button event handler which activates methods modifying the button's appearance and notifying all listeners upon a click event.
- **Observer Subscription & Notification:**
   - `FormMain` class subscribes to `m_ReportClickedDelegates` and associates it with the `DisplayModeChange` method to be activated upon receiving notifications.
   - `notifyClickObservers` method employs null checks and invoke to notify existing subscribers safely.
- **Independent Action:**
   - Each observer acts independently in response to notifications, performing actions defined within their scope.

## Design Pattern No. 6 ‚Äì Strategy

### Reason for Using the Pattern:
The Strategy pattern was utilized for the `FilteredPost` feature, allowing users diverse filtering options for their Facebook posts, such as viewing all posts, posts from the last month, or posts with more than ten likes. This facilitates future extensions by enabling the addition of more filtering logic without affecting existing classes, thereby promoting maintainability, flexibility, and reusability.

### How the Pattern Solves it:
This pattern encapsulates different filtering logics within separate classes, each implementing a common interface, making the system modular and promoting loose coupling between classes using the logic and those implementing it.

### Implementation Method:
- **Interface & Classes:**
   - A `IFilterStrategy` interface with a `Select` method is defined, and three classes: `ShowAllFilter`, `MoreThanTenLikesFilter`, and `LastMonthFilter` implement this interface, each encapsulating a unique filter logic.
   - A `FilterStrategy` class holds a composition instance of `IFilterStrategy`.
- **Application of Strategy:**
   - An instance of `FilterStrategy` is created in `FormMain` and the user's choice determines the type of filter it holds in composition.
   - This instance is passed to the `fetchFilteredPosts` method to display posts according to the chosen strategy.
- **Utilizing LINQ:**
   - `MoreThanTenLikesFilter` and `LastMonthFilter` implement the `Select` function using LINQ for improved performance, readability, and maintainability.
